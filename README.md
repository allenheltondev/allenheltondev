## Hi, I’m Allen 👋

I'm an engineer who works best in ambiguous problem spaces.

I build systems to learn, ship prototypes quickly to validate ideas with real users, and iterate until the right abstractions emerge. I'm most effective when given a problem to solve rather than a predefined roadmap.

This GitHub account is my public R&D lab:
- Small, focused prototypes exploring APIs, platforms, and system design
- Reference implementations for event-driven and cloud-native architectures
- Experiments built to answer specific technical questions quickly

Some longer-running work lives here:
- Ready Set Cloud — https://github.com/readysetcloud  
- Null Check — https://github.com/nullchecktv

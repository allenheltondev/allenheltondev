## Hi, I’m Allen 👋

I'm a career engineer who works best in ambiguous problem spaces.

I build systems to learn, ship prototypes quickly to validate ideas with real users, and iterate until the right abstractions emerge. I'm most effective when given a problem to solve rather than a predefined roadmap.

---

### How I work

- I treat prototypes as learning tools, not throwaway work.
- I optimize for speed of insight over polish early, then harden what proves valuable.
- I prefer small, concrete experiments over long theoretical debates.
- I'm comfortable operating across engineering, product, and developer experience when clarity is needed.

### What you'll find here

This GitHub account is my public R&D lab.

- Reference implementations for cloud-native and event-driven systems  
- Rapid prototypes exploring new APIs, platforms, and architectural patterns  
- Open-source tools built to answer specific technical questions  
- Experiments that start as side projects and often inform my professional work  

Most repositories are intentionally small and focused—they exist to test ideas quickly and document what I learned.

### Showcase work

- **AI agents & workflow orchestration**: multi-step systems, tool calling, and coordination patterns  
- **Event-driven architectures**: webhooks, pub/sub, long polling, and async workflows  
- **Developer platforms**: APIs, SDK ergonomics, and adoption-friendly patterns  
- **Cloud experiments**: performance, tradeoffs, and failure modes in real systems

### IRL

- Engineer currently operating across engineering, product, and ecosystem work
- Former enterprise architect and cloud R&D lead
- AWS Serverless Hero
- International speaker and technical writer

Some of my longer-running work lives across organizations:

- **Ready Set Cloud**: tools, automations, and experiments built to explore and document real-world cloud and serverless patterns  
  https://github.com/readysetcloud

- **Null Check**: demos and systems built for live technical exploration, rapid prototyping, and agentic AI design discussions  
  https://github.com/nullchecktv


I'm always interested in problems that sit at the edge of systems, product, and learning.
